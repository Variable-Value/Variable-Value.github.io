# The Variable-Value approach to Programming <br> And The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ programming language is a Java-like language that is being developed to serve as an example of Variable-Value programming. The code repository is at
<br> <https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ>

### Results from a Recent Test of the Specifications

One way to learn the TrueJ language is by reading the [Cucumber output of a recent test](https://variable-value.github.io/TestHtml/) of the [testable specifications](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>).

### Results from a Recent Test of the Prover's Executable Specification

The TrueJ compiler proves that certain statements are valid, and the prover that is used also has testable specifications. However, readability is a work in progress for the [test results](https://variable-value.github.io/Prover/). You may prefer to look at the [testable specifications for the prover](https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/ProofTestFeatures) for a slightly more readable version.

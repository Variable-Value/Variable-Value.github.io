# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
The Variable-Value approach uses variables for changing state and values for understanding states

# The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ repository is currently just a stub, waiting for upload of the code:
github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ 

For now, here are the test results for the variable names in the TrueJ language, to give you an idea of the direction that the 
project is headed. The formatting is done by Cucumber; we'll clean that up later. There is also a review of other related work and references at the bottom of the Value Names Feature page.

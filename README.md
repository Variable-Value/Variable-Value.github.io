# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
# And The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ programming language is a Java-like language that is being developed to serve as an example of Variable-Value programming. The code repository is at
<br> <https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ>

## The Executable Specifications

One way to learn the TrueJ language is with the executable specifications in the [Cucumber/Features](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>) folder. The top level folders begin with an alphabetical character that puts them in a suggested reading order.

The executable specification is being written in Cucumber, but unfortunately the Cucumber testing tool does not generate well formatted test results. Nevertheless, here they are for you to take a look.

### Results from a Recent Test of the Prover's Executable Specification

[Prover Test Results](https://variable-value.github.io/Prover/) (see [Proof Features](https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/ProofTestFeatures) for a more readable version, but readability is a work in progress)

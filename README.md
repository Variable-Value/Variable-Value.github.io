# The Variable-Value approach to Programming <br> And The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ programming language is a Java-like language that is being developed to serve as an example of Variable-Value programming. The code repository is at <https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ>

### Results from a Recent Test of the Specifications

One way to learn the TrueJ language is by reading the [Cucumber output of a recent test](https://variable-value.github.io/TestHtml/) of the [testable specifications](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>).

### Results from a Recent Test of the Prover's Executable Specification

The TrueJ compiler proves that the execution of the code will cause given facts about the data to become true, and the prover that is used also has testable specifications. However, readability is a work in progress for these [test results](https://variable-value.github.io/Prover/). The [prover's testable specifications](https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/ProofTestFeatures) are also available.

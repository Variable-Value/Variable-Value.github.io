# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
The Variable-Value approach uses variables for changing state and values for understanding states

# The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ repository is at

## The Executable Specifications

Here are recent test results from the executable specifications for TrueJ, to give you an idea of the direction that the 
project is headed. I will update this from time to time as we make significant progress. Unfortunately, the formatting for the tests is the default generated from Cucumber, and we'll need to clean that up later. There is a review of other related work and references at the bottom of the Value Names Feature page.

# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
The Variable-Value approach uses variables for changing state and values for understanding states

# The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ repository is at

## The Executable Specifications

The best way to learn the TrueJ language is the executable specifications in the [Cucumber/Features](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>) folder. The top level folders begin with two alphabetical characters putting them in a suggested reading order.

Unfortunately, we'll need to do some work to make the test results more readable because their formatting is the default generated from Cucumber.

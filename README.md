# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
The Variable-Value approach uses variables for changing state and values for understanding states.

# The TrueJ Project

The TrueJ repository is at

## The Executable Specifications

The best way to learn the TrueJ language is the executable specifications in the [Cucumber/Features](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>) folder. The top level folders begin with two alphabetical characters putting them in a suggested reading order.

Unfortunately, the Cucumber testing tool does not generate well formatted test results, but we include them here for you to take a look.

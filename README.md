# The Variable-Value approach to Programming
Using variables for changing state <br> and values for understanding state.

## The Executable Specifications

The best way to learn the TrueJ language is the executable specifications in the [Cucumber/Features](<https://github.com/Variable-Value/TrueJ/tree/master/Cucumber/Features/Spec%20Features>) folder. The top level folders begin with an alphabetical character that puts them in a suggested reading order.

The executable specification is being written in Cucumber, Unfortunately, the Cucumber testing tool does not generate well formatted test results, but we include them here for you to take a look.
